# SkyBlockItems
You are too poor to buy a Hyperion or Terminator in Skyblock? No Problem with this simple plugin. The SkyblockItems Plugin lets you play Skyblock Items on a private Server.
Right now the Plugin contains following Items:
- Hyperion 
- Black Storm
- Sceptre (doesnt work properly)
- Terminator
- and a few custom Items

Commands:
- /itemsgui (opens gui with the Items)
- /boss (spawns a simple Giant with 500HP)
- /storm (Typical Storm's Armor as Chestplate, Leggings and Boots)
- /blackStorm (Just the Black Dyed Storm's Chestplate, Leggings and Boots)

The plugin isn't finished yet and its just my Current Progress. A better Update will be published Soon.
